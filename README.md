# LinguaApp â€” A Modern MERN Stack Communication Platform

**LinguaApp** is a secure and modern web application built with the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. It provides a robust platform for user communication, featuring a clean interface and a scalable backend architecture.

## Key Features

  * **Secure User Authentication**: User registration and login system with password protection using **bcryptjs** for hashing.
  * **React-Based Frontend**: A dynamic and responsive user interface built with **React** and bundled with **Vite** for a fast development experience.
  * **Node.js & Express Backend**: A powerful backend server to handle API requests, business logic, and database interactions.
  * **MongoDB Integration**: Uses **Mongoose** for elegant data modeling and interaction with a MongoDB database.
  * **Modern Styling**: Styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a utility-first, customizable design.
  * **Client-Server Architecture**: Uses **Axios** for seamless HTTP communication between the React frontend and the Express backend.
  * **Concurrent Development Workflow**: The frontend and backend can be run simultaneously with a single command using **`concurrently`**.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

### 2\. Install Dependencies

This project uses a single `package.json` to manage both frontend and backend dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3\. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project. You will need to add your MongoDB connection string and any other necessary environment variables.

```env
MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
PORT=5000
```

> **Note:** The `package.json` also includes a script to start a Python backend (`"start-backend": "python ./backend/app.py"`). If you are using the Node.js backend (as suggested by the Express and Mongoose dependencies), you will need to create a server file (e.g., `server.js`) and modify the `start-backend` script accordingly.

### 4\. Run the Application

The `start` script uses `concurrently` to run both the backend server and the frontend development server at the same time.

```bash
npm start
```

This command will:

1.  Start the backend server (you may need to adjust the `start-backend` script in `package.json` to `node server.js` if you are using the Node.js stack).
2.  Start the Vite frontend development server.

The application will be available at **`http://localhost:5173`** (or another port specified by Vite).

## Available Scripts

In the `package.json` file, you can find the following scripts:

  * `npm run dev`: Starts the Vite development server for the frontend.
  * `npm run build`: Bundles the React application for production.
  * `npm run lint`: Lints the project files using ESLint.
  * `npm run preview`: Serves the production build locally for previewing.
  * `npm start`: Runs both the backend and frontend concurrently.
